#  Forecasting Seasonal Influenza Epidemics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks

This repository contains the code to evaluate and use **SIR-INN**, an epidemiological probabilistic forecasting framework based on a physics-informed neural approximation of the SIR model.

The repository is designed to be **readable and reproducible by users with no prior knowledge of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**. It contains the data, the model, and the code of [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03897).

## Overview

The SIR-INN pipeline consists of the following conceptual steps:

0. Dataset generation and model pretraining 
1. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of SIR-INN approximation abilities   ->   `01_SIR_approximation.ipynb`
2. SIR-INN parameters inference via MCMC                                        ->   `02_parameters_inference.ipynb`
3. Probabilistic forecasting                                                    ->   `03_forecast.ipynb`

Since the focus of this work is on model evaluation, parameter inference, and forecasting, this repository provides steps **1, 2, and 3**, for reproducibility. 
For this reason, as step **0**, we only include the synthetic dataset and the **pretrained SIR-INN model**, leaving the implementation details explanation in the work: [1].

All notebooks are intended to be executed from the repository root and can be run in Google Colab. Specifically, after cloning the repository with 

`!git clone https://github.com/martina-rama/SIR-INN.git`, 

make sure to install the required packages before running any notebook:

`!pip install -r /content/SIR-INN/requirements.txt`.

You can then execute each notebook with the following command (example for the first notebook):

`!jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3 \
  --output /content/output_01_notebook.ipynb \
  /content/SIR-INN/notebooks/01_SIR_approximation.ipynb`

The executed notebook with all outputs will be saved as `output_01_notebook.ipynb`. Figures and results will be saved in the related subfolders inside `tmp_results/`.
